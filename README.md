🪙 Leveraging Random Forest, Regression, and KNN for Predicting Prices of Cryptocurrencies
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies based on historical market data. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of three key predictive models — Random Forest, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — in capturing the complex, nonlinear patterns present in cryptocurrency price movements.

By leveraging these models, the project aims to identify which algorithm provides the most accurate and reliable forecasts, helping traders and analysts make more data-driven decisions in the highly volatile crypto market.

⚙️ Key Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering from real cryptocurrency datasets.

Implementation of Random Forest, Linear Regression, and KNN models.

Model training, validation, and performance comparison using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².

Visualization of predictions versus actual price trends.

Insights into how traditional ML models perform on financial time series data.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization

Historical Crypto Data API (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance, or CSV datasets)

🎯 Objective

To develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting short-term cryptocurrency price trends and to analyze the comparative effectiveness of ensemble, regression, and distance-based algorithms in financial forecasting tasks.
